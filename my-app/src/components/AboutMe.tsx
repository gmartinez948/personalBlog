    <div className="AboutMe">
      I am a full stack software engineer with one year of experience working
      with Ruby on Rails, Typescript/Javascript, React, and GraphQL. During my
      time at Gusto, I worked on new product features that helped customers stay
      tax compliant, improved the codebase by tackling tech debt, and fixed bugs
      in production code. I have a strong passion for seeing projects come to
      life. There is nothing cooler than starting with an idea and ending with a
      well-tested, successful product. Another passion of mine is finding and
      fixing bugs. I love the "AHA" moment and then writing reliable tests to
      prevent the unwanted behavior. Although I am animated about software
      development, I also love working with people! Every week, you will find my
      calendar stacked with pairing sessions because I believe that is the best
      way to learn - from each other. Currently, I am searching for a new
      opportunity. Please reach out to me if you have any connections or are
      looking to hire for an L1 engineer.
